DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:

  This project is a Personal Portfolio Website, created as part of Internship Task – 1. The main objective of this task was to design and develop a static, responsive, and visually appealing portfolio website that accurately represents a developer’s professional identity. The website is built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of any external frameworks, thereby fulfilling the requirement of constructing a pure static website.

The website contains several well-structured sections that highlight different aspects of my profile. It begins with a Hero/Introduction Section, where I briefly introduce myself as an aspiring software developer. This section is designed to create a strong first impression and immediately convey my identity and professional focus.

Next is the About Me Section, where I describe my motivation, personal interests in technology, and approach to learning. This section provides insight into my personality, work ethic, and professional aspirations. Following this, the Skills Section presents my technical abilities in a clean, organized, and easy-to-read format. Skills such as Python, C, C++, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase, Communication and Team Collaboration are showcased clearly to highlight my core competencies.

One of the key components of the portfolio is the Projects Section, which is presented in a two-column card layout. This layout ensures better visual organization and readability. Each project card includes the project title and a short description of what the project accomplishes. The showcased projects demonstrate hands-on experience in areas like Artificial Intelligence, IoT-based systems, UI/UX prototyping, and real-world web application development.

**The Certifications Section is displayed using individual certification cards instead of bullet points. Each card contains the certification name, issuing organization, and year of completion. Certifications included are:**

Data Science with MATLAB – MathWorks

Web Development Internship – InternPe

Certified Solution Architect Virtual Internship – Forage

This improves visual clarity and highlights professional learning achievements effectively.
The website concludes with a Contact Section, where visitors can find my email address, LinkedIn profile, and location for professional communication. This section allows recruiters, collaborators, or organizations to reach out easily.

**Tools Used:**

HTML – Structure and content layout

CSS – Styling, layout design, responsiveness

JavaScript – Interactivity and dynamic elements

Git & GitHub – Version control and deployment platform

**Editor / Platform Used:**

**Where This Website Can Be Applied**:

As a Personal Branding Website

Overall, this portfolio website demonstrates my ability to work with core web technologies, structure information effectively, and design user-friendly interfaces. This task strengthened my knowledge in front-end development, improved my understanding of responsive design principles, and helped me learn how to present my profile in a professional and visually structured format.
